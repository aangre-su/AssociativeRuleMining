#This project is an analysis on the AdultUCI dataset which comes with arules package, it follows the CRISP-DM process for
- Data exploration and Descriptive statistics
– Data preprocessing, cleaning, transformation
– Runs association rule mining algorithm using default settings
– Finally, Fine tuning the model by experimenting with different algorithm parameters
– Outputting and presenting the most interesting and significant rules which could predict “income”
– Provides interpretations of the above chosen association rules and discusses why these rules are considered
  interesting and significant
  
 #The final result of this experiment is hosted on Shiny App and can be viewed by redirecting to the URL posted Line 4
